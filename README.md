# Residential Building Classification with XGBoost Based on Morphological Character and OpenStreetMap Atributes (OSM)

## Description
This is a my final project for my bachelor of Geodetic Engineering from Gadjah Mada Univeristy. With this project, we can identify residential building from an OpenStreetMap building dataset using only the building geometry and its OSM atributes.
